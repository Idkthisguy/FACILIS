#  FACILIS
**C++ power with Python simplicity.**

FACILIS is a lightweight, high-performance C++ library designed to strip away the boilerplate of standard C++. It provides a "Python-like" experience for file management, UI, and string handling without losing the raw speed of C++.

## About the Project
**FACILIS** is a solo project created by a 13-year-old student as a hobby. 
The goal is to make C++ feel as intuitive as Python, removing the "scary" boilerplate while keeping the raw power of the language.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** This is a passion project! The syntax and features are constantly evolving. Expect "experimental" code—I'm learning as I build, and that’s part of the fun.
